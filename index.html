            <dt >Evolution</dt>
            <dd>In 1989, the sportier "Evolution" model (also called "EVO1") of European M3s were upgraded to the 158 kW (215 PS; 212 hp) (as introduced on the Ravaglia special edition model), increasing the top speed to 240 km/h (149 mph).[13] Non catalytic converter "Evolution" model (also called "EVO2") introduced in 1988 was rated at 162 kW (220 PS; 217 hp).[14] Other changes included larger wheels (16 × 7.5 inches), thinner rear and side window glass, a lighter bootlid, a deeper front splitter[15] and an additional rear spoiler. A total of 505 cars were produced, including 40 sold in France as the "Tour de Corse"</dd>
            <dt>Sport Evolution</dt>
            <dd>A more powerful and lighter "Sport Evolution" model (sometimes referred to as "EVO3"), with a limited production run of 600 units, was produced with an upgraded 2,467 cc (150.5 cu in) engine rated at 175 kW (238 PS; 235 hp) at 7,000 rpm and 240 N⋅m (177 lbf⋅ft) at 4,750 rpm.[16][17] The top speed was increased to 250 km/h (154 mph).[13] Sport Evolution models have enlarged front bumper openings and an adjustable multi-position front splitter[15] and rear wing. Brake cooling ducts were installed in place of front foglights.</dd>
            <dt>Ravaglia and Cecotto editions</dt>
            <dd>In April 1989, the Ravaglia and Cecotto limited editions were released, both named after Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) racing drivers. Power was increased to 158 kW (215 PS; 212 hp) with a catalytic converter.[14] Cecotto Edition production consisted of 480 cars, plus 80 cars for the Swiss market de-tuned to 155 kW (211 PS; 208 hp) to meet Swiss emissions limits. The production run for the Ravaglia Edition consisted of 25 cars.[16]</dd>
            <dt>M3 Pickup prototype</dt>
            <dd>In 1986, BMW produced an "M3 Pickup" prototype pickup truck, based on the convertible model. The M3 Pickup used the narrower body of regular E30 models and was originally powered by the 2.0-litre version of the S14 engine from the Italian-specification M3. It was used by BMW M as a transporter for roughly 26 years before it was officially retired in 2012.</dd>
